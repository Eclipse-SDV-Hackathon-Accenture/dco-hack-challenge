For the automotive industry, the transformation arena has shifted to software and software-defined platforms in recent years, and this is expected to continue as differentiation and price competitiveness remain the primary focus. Recent automotive innovations, such as infotainment, sensor-based detection, and driving dynamics, rely on software precision, quality, scalability, and integration rather than mechanical ingenuity. As the transition from mechanical to electro-mechanical to essentially software-driven becomes more prominent, more frequent updates over the air are required, such as 1. Software OTA, 2. Configuration OTA, 3. Firmware OTA, and 4. Application OTA.

Release Management is a key component/microservice of the Developer Console. The goal of DCO-Release Management is to to test, approve and release vehicle software updates for the after sales vehicles in shorter cycles.Â
